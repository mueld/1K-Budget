# 1K-Budget 2019

This is robot project. This is a cross-training project consisting of the following disciplines: systems engineering, electrical engineering and mechanical engineering.
This project serves to expand my very basic knowledge of programming that i have acquired through studying systems engineering.

## Task
Find and collect 6 coloured cubes. When all cubes have been collected,  they must be placed in a specific offloading area.Once all the cubes are placed in the area, the robot must park in the defined parking area. 


## Technologies
To find the coloured cubes it will use the pixy camera 2.

To orientate in the field the robot has ladar sensors attachted to each side of it. 
The robto has mecanum wheels. These allows it to move in any direction and turn around its own axis.
